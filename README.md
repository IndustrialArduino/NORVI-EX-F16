# NORVI-EX-F16
 an expansion module with 16 MOSFET outputs.
 
NORVI is always about connectivity and expandability. This is the time to make use of the Expansion port of NORVI Controllers. 
The series of expansion modules connect to NORVI IoT controllers via its I2C and UART connections. 
You can add more features to the NORVI Controller without huge customizations. 
NORVI provides true technology with reliability for industrial applications being the world's IoT hardware manufacturer.

Optically Isolated MOSFET Outputs
Supports up to loads of 36V DC
MCP23017T-E/SO Port Expander
Address Configurable Over DIP Switch
